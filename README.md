Task Notification Acceptance Application
This is work in progress.
The purpose of this esoteric little contrivance is to expedite the anachronistic process of the requirement for students to physically indicate their acceptance of an assessment task.
When a task is given to Stage 6 (years 11 and 12) students they are required to sign and date a document registering their acceptance of the task notification. My school's policy extends that to all students in all high school stages.
Kids being kids, sign the document "Micky Mouse" and other hilarious names - they think it's the funniest thing around. We teachers are then required to identify the non-signatories and rectify the omission - or seek out "Micky Mouse" and get him or her to resign the page. It is totally ridiculous.
Students will turn an omission (whether it's their fault or not) into an advantage by claiming they should be allowed extra time because the task, which has already been published in the yearly assessment schedule, was not brought to their attention within the 2 weeks between notification and submission. 
The process adds to the already noisy situation around teaching and serves no pedagogical purpose.
This application is an attempt to streamline the process wherein students have to scan a QR barcode and their details along with the details of the task are stored in a database.
Technology
This programmed solution allowed me to explore the use of ES6 classes using the more conventional OO type keywords (class, constructor etc).
It also allowed me to dabble in the use of ES6 promises and Jquery delegates - to mixed effect.
The architecture relies heavily on AJAX calls to PHP on the server which runs the required SQL to query and populate the MariaDB database.
